        "2. **Reusability**: APIs enable developers to use pre-built functions or services, avoiding the need to write code from scratch.\n",
        "3. **Scalability**: APIs make it easy to scale applications by integrating additional services or features without major changes to the core system.\n",

        "**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, primarily over HTTP. It relies on stateless communication, where each request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand and process the request. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Stateless**: Each request is independent, and the server does not store any session data.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: REST is designed to be lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for high-performance web services.\n",
        "- **Flexible Formats**: REST commonly uses JSON for data interchange, but XML and other formats can be used.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### SOAP Architecture:\n",
        "**SOAP** (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. SOAP messages are typically formatted in XML and use HTTP (or SMTP, TCP) for message transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Protocol-based**: SOAP is a strict, standardized protocol with a defined set of rules for message format and processing.\n",
        "- **Stateful/Stateless**: SOAP can be both stateful or stateless.\n",
        "- **Security**: SOAP provides advanced security features (WS-Security), making it suitable for secure enterprise applications.\n",
        "- **Complexity**: SOAP includes additional headers, standards, and protocols for transactions and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
        "1. **Complexity**: SOAP messages are verbose and require more processing because they are XML-based and include additional headers for security, transactions, and routing.\n",
        "2. **Performance**: The XML format used in SOAP can be slower compared to the lightweight JSON format used by REST.\n",
        "3. **Tight Coupling**: SOAP is more rigid and tightly coupled to specific service definitions, making it harder to change or scale.\n",
        "4. **Limited Browser Support**: SOAP is not natively supported by browsers and requires more complex setups (like additional libraries) for communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, **REST** is simpler and more flexible, making it widely used for web services today."
